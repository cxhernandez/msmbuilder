Transition Path Theory
======================


Background
----------
This module contains functions for analyzing Markov state models, with an
emphasis on Transition Path Theory (TPT)

These are the canonical references for TPT. Note that TPT is really a
specialization of ideas very familiar to the mathematical study of Markov
chains, and there are many books, manuscripts in the mathematical literature
that cover the same concepts.
